# 3D_Fundamentals
Base code for the Planet Chili tutorial series "3D Fundamentals" on YouTube.

Most if not all of my code is in the branches, I made my main branch "lemme-dev-it" back at the start of chili's tutorials 
and have made all the code from that branch on my own way in the same style and order as chili.
